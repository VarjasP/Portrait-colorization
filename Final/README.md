This is our final projet folder. We will be updating the Neural Network and the documantation til 2018/12/09 23:59.

Some of our output files from these notebooks can be found in [this google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GB7gAP8Ijl1-H7TTywBR4JnsSyYxGz_t?usp=sharing). Such as dataset, saved models, logs.

The notebooks contain the following:
- Colorization.ipynb - This notebook helps compare, and show our results. It imports 4 of our pretrained networks, and visualizes their results.
- Data Processing.ipynb - Contains all the code for downloading, extracting, processing the IMDB database which we used. The result of this notebook is a allDataLab.h5 file which is the training, validatin, and testing database consisting ~240 000 images. We have a standalone documentations named Data Processing.pdf which explains some of the filtering done to our dataset. Note that this was made for the first milestone, and parts of it are outdated.
- Discriminator.ipynb - We used this notebook to teach the discriminator of our GAN network, to learn how to distinguish images generated by our U-Net CNN and real images.
- GAN.ipynb - This contains our different GAN networks for image colorization. Its difficult to say which is the best, since realistic colorization is a highly subjective topic.
- UNET.ipynb - Our CNN based on the U-Net arhitecture. This network produces the best results still so far.

This is our final projet folder. We well be updating the Neural Network and the documantation til 2018/12/09 23:59.

The notebooks contain the following:
- Colorization.ipynb - This notebook helps compare, and show our results. It imports 4 of our pretrained networks, and visualizes their results.
- Data Processing.ipynb - Contains all the code for downloading, extracting, processing the IMDB database which we used. The result of this notebook is a AllData.h5 file which is the training, validatin, and testing database consisting ~240 000 images. We have a standalone documentations named Data Processing.pdf which explains some of the filtering done to our dataset. Note that this was made for the first milestone, and parts of it are outdated.
